Hello, I'm Shreya Deshpande, a Master's student specializing in Information Systems at Northeastern University with an expected graduation date of December 2025. My academic journey is complemented by a solid foundation in Computer Science from Smt. Kashibai College of Engineering, where I achieved a GPA of 3.8/4.0.

At present, I'm sharpening my skills in data-driven technologies and actively seeking innovative project ideas that can make a significant impact in the tech industry. My technical proficiency spans across languages like Python, R, Java, and JavaScript, and extends to adeptness in databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB.

With a keen interest in full-stack web design, I am currently broadening my skill set to include front-end and back-end development, which supplements my substantial knowledge in data science and machine learning. My tenure as an Application Senior Analyst at Accenture saw me leading initiatives to enhance data processes with SQL, Python, and various data visualization tools, significantly improving data quality and operational workflows.

For collaborations or to discuss potential projects, I am available at
